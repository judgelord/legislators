# Find U.S. legislator names in messy text with typos and inconsistent name formats

## legislators: Find legislator names in messy text ![](reference/figures/logo.png)[![CRAN status](https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/legislators)](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=legislators)

### Installation

``` R
devtools::install_github("judgelord/legislators")
```

``` r
library(legislators)
```

## Data

This package relies on a dataframe (`members`) of permutations of the
names of members of Congress. This dataframe builds on the basic
structure of voteview.com data, especially the `bioname` field. From
this and other corrections, it constructs a regular expression search
`pattern` and conditions under which this pattern should yield a match
(e.g., when that pattern has a unique match to a member of Congress in a
given Congress). `pattern` differs from Congress to Congress because
some members move from the House to the Senate and because members with
similar names join or leave Congress. Users can customize the provided
`members` data and supply their updated version to
[`extractMemberName()`](https://judgelord.github.io/legislators/reference/extractMemberName.md).

``` r
data("members")

dim(members)
```

Before searching the text, several functions clean it and “fix” common
human typos and OCR errors that frustrate matching. These corrections
are currently supplied in the `typos` dataset, and all types of
corrections (cleaning, typos, OCR errors) are optional. Additionally,
users can customize the `typos` dataset and provide it as an argument to
[`extractMemberName()`](https://judgelord.github.io/legislators/reference/extractMemberName.md).

``` r
data("typos")

head(typos)

## Basic Usage

The main function,
[`extractMemberName()`](https://judgelord.github.io/legislators/reference/extractMemberName.md),
returns a dataframe of the names and ICPSR ID numbers of members of
Congress in a supplied vector of text.

> in the future,
> [`extractMemberName()`](https://judgelord.github.io/legislators/reference/extractMemberName.md)
> may default to returning a list of dataframes the same length as the
> supplied data

For example, we can use
[`extractMemberName()`](https://judgelord.github.io/legislators/reference/extractMemberName.md)
to detect the names of members of Congress in the text of the
Congressional Record. Let’s start with text from the Congressional
Record from 3/1/2007, scraped and parsed using methods described
[here](https://judgelord.github.io/congressionalrecord/).

``` r
data("cr2007_03_01")

head(cr2007_03_01)
```

``` r
head(cr2007_03_01$url)

``` R
#> [1] "https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/01/extensions-of-remarks-section/article/E431-2"

```

This is an extremely simple example because the text strings containing
the names of the members of Congress in the `speaker` column are short,
consistently formatted, and do not contain much other text. However,
[`extractMemberName()`](https://judgelord.github.io/legislators/reference/extractMemberName.md)
can also search much longer and messier texts, including text where
names are not consistently formatted or where they contain common typos
introduced by humans or common OCR errors. Indeed, these functions were
developed to identify members of Congress in ugly text data like
[this](https://judgelord.github.io/corr/corr_pres.html#22).

To better match member names, this function currently requires either:

- a column “congress” (this can be created from a date) or
- a vector of congresses to limit the search to supplied to the
  `congresses` argument

For illustration, I show both options in the example below.

Member names augmented from voteview come with the `legislators`
package, but users can also supply a customized version of these data to
the `members` argument.

### `extractMemberName()`

``` r
# extract legislator names and match to voteview ICPSR numbers
cr <- extractMemberName(data = cr2007_03_01, 
                        col_name = "speaker", # The text strings to search
                        congress = 110,
                        cl = 4 #Use 4 cores (on Mac)
)
```

``` R

```

In this example, all observations are in the 110th Congress, so we only
search for members who served in the 110th.

Because
[`extractMemberName()`](https://judgelord.github.io/legislators/reference/extractMemberName.md)
links each detected name to ICPSR IDs from voteview.com, we already have
some information, like state and district for each legislator detected
in the text (scroll to the right).

## TODO

### Dynamic data

make some kind of version-controlled spreadsheet where users can submit
additional nicknames, maiden names, etc. to augment the voteview data.
This is currently done in data/make_members/nameCongress.R, but it would
not be easy for users to edit and then re-make the regex table.

make some sort of version-controlled spreadsheet where users can submit
common typos they find. Currently, typos.R generates typos.rda, which is
loaded with the package.

### Vignettes

Add a vignette using messy OCRed legislator letters to FERC from
replication data for [“Legislator Advocacy on Behalf of Constituents and
Corporate Donors”](https://judgelord.github.io/research/ferc/)

Add a vignette using [public comment
data](https://github.com/judgelord/rulemaking) (sparse legislator names)

### Functions

[`extractMemberName()`](https://judgelord.github.io/legislators/reference/extractMemberName.md)
needs options to supply custom typos and additions to the main regex
table

correcting OCR errors and typos should be optional in
[`extractMemberName()`](https://judgelord.github.io/legislators/reference/extractMemberName.md)

integrate with the [`congress`](https://github.com/ippsr/congress)
and/or [`congressData`](https://github.com/IPPSR/congress) packages. For
example, we may want a function (`augmentCongress` or
`augment_legislators`?) to join in identifiers for other datasets on
ICPSR numbers. Perhaps this is best left to users using the `congress`
package.

Additionally, `committees.R` provides a crosswalk for Stewart ICPSR
numbers

Support dates for congress

### Documentation

Document helper functions for
[`extractMemberName()`](https://judgelord.github.io/legislators/reference/extractMemberName.md)

Document additional functions that help prep text for best matching

Document example data (including FERC and public comment data for new
vignettes)
